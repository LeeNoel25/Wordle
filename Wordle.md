Wordle - Animal Edition
Wordle is an exciting word guessing game that can be played solo or with friends. In this edition, we'll be focusing on animal-related words.

Objective
The goal of Wordle is to guess the correct word within six attempts. Each attempt reveals new information to guide you towards the right answer.

Gameplay
You will start by selecting an animal-related word at random.
The word is hidden, and you must guess the letters to uncover it.
If a letter turns "Green," this means that the letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
If a letter turns "Yellow," this means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
If a letter turns "Red," this means that the letter is not in the word at all.
With each guess, you will learn new information about the hidden word.

Tips
Start with the vowels: A, E, I, O, U.
Focus on high-frequency letters like T, N, S, R.
Use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.
Take note of the letters that are "Yellow" to help you figure out their correct position.

Conclusion
Wordle - Animal Edition is a fun and engaging way to test your word-guessing skills while learning about different animals. With each round, you'll develop a sharper eye for letter patterns and word structure. Good luck and have fun!
